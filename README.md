React single-page site: Places I've Lived Since College

This single-page React app describes the places I've lived since college. 

I've bounced around a lot since I graduated, following jobs and fellowships and residencies back and forth across the country. Each stay was short enough to measure in days, but long enough to call home. 

This site is laid out in a vertical timeline format, with the most recent home at the top. Click on each map to find learn more about why and how long I was there.

**This repo only contains the "src" and "public" folders from my React app, so you can see the code I wrote. It does not include the "node_modules" folder. 
**It also includes the "build" folder, which is used to deploy it to Netlify. 

**View the app running here: https://festive-neumann-93676d.netlify.com/
